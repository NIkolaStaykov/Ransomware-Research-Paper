abstract = {The fundamental recovery technique for some medium failures in a database system is regularly carried out by executing a full backup that takes all copies of updated files. However, the overhead of such full backup becomes sometimes very large in a massive database system. To lessen the overhead of backups, an incremental backup with small overhead, which takes only copies of newly updated files, is usually adopted in most database systems. However, the overhead of an incremental backup increases in proportion to the total amount of updated files. It would be necessary to determine when to make full backups. This paper proposes a stochastic model with incremental and full backups: the expected costs incurred for two backups are obtained, and an optimal full backup interval which minimizes them is discussed. It is shown that an optimal interval is given by a finite and unique solution of an equation under suitable conditions. Finally, a numerical example is given and some useful discussions are made.},

abstract = {This paper discusses checkpoint generations for a database recovery mechanism. The density of checkpoint generations is analytically derived from minimizing the expected total overhead to completion of a phase, and this density yields the optimum sequence of checkpoint generations measured in unit of update pages. We further present the numerical examples for the results obtained and show that the sequence gives effective checkpoint generations.},

@article{Sun2016,
abstract = {This paper studies the customers' equilibrium and socially optimal balking strategies in single-server Markovian queues with multiple vacations and N-policy. That is, the server starts taking a vacation time once the system becomes empty, and reactivates in case at least N customers waiting in the queue after completing the vacation. Otherwise, he/she continues taking another vacation. We discuss the fully observable and fully unobservable queues, respectively. For each type of queues, we get both customers' equilibrium and optimal balking strategies, and make numerical comparisons between them. We observe that the customers' individual behavior in stable equilibrium always makes the system more congested than the socially optimal one. Moreover, we also make sensitivity analysis of customers' equilibrium and optimal strategies and social welfare with respect to N and the vacation parameter, respectively. It shows that customers and the social planner all prefer a classical Markovian queue without vacations and N-policy. By comparing social welfare under the two information cases, we find that whether the system information should be revealed to customers depends on the potential arrivals of demand.},
